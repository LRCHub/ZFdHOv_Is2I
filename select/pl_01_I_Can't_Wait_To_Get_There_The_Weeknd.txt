Yeah
The darkness keeps you shining
Shine, shine, shine
Shine, shine, shine
Ooh,
just sign on the dotted line
Line, line, line
Line, line, line (Ooh)
I can't wait to get there,
I know
(Oh, know, know, oh, love, love)
I can't wait to get there,
aware, my heart (Oh, love, love)
I wish I could get there
to know
(Oh, love, love, oh, love, love)
Where my love can grow,
oh, oh (Ooh)
Dear summer,
we've been runnin' the numbers
We just shy off a billi',
sold my crib to Madonna
Might connect to my father,
I don't know that nigga
Tryna end all my dramas,
tryna clean up my closet
'Cause the media hate it
when they can never control us
And my enemies hate it
'cause I own my soul
I know (I know)
When they think I don't,
I know (I know)
I know (I know)
And they try to fuckin' kill me,
spreadin' misinformation
Tryna paint me a villain
Guess I did it to myself, man,
this business life pimping
Who can tell me the difference?
Dealt with scarier situations,
I had nowhere to live in
High school dropout,
chillin' with academics
Now I can finish a sentence
Now I'm articulate, baby
And I enunciate, baby
And I eviscerate my enemies
and piss on they grave, yeah
And I swear I'm gon' do it,
I know
I can't wait to get there,
I know
Every time
I look into those eyes
(I know, know, know, know, know)
All the tears
drop down your face
(I know, know, know)
(I get the game, I know)
I can't wait to get there,
aware, my heart
I wish I could get there to know
(You need the right complexion
for the right protection,
for the right intention,
for the, for the, for the)
Where my love can grow
(For the, for the right,
for the right, ooh)
Every time
I look into those eyes
Look into those eyes
and all the tears
drop down your face
(I can't wait to get there,
woah, oh)
Aware, my heart
I wish I could get there to know
Where my love can grow, oh, oh
I can't wait to get there,
I know
I can't wait to get there
